#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements involves Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design involves Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation involves Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing involves Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is Sequential approach with distinct phases such as requirements, design and implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile is Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
The importance of testing is that it ensures that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting  questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from a robot or AI assistant. 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: what is hydropower
Better prompt: Imagine you are an expert in the field of hydropower and you have been assigned to teach civil engineering students on the aspcets of hydropower, give a detailed outline of the contents for such a lesson. 
the improved prompt is more effective as it will give the required content as specified.
